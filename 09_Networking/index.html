                <h1 class="page-header">The Plan</h1>
                <p>For my final project, I will need a wirelessly controlled stepper motor. The stepper motor will need to be finely tuned in orde to focus the telescope. Therefore, for this project, I wanted to create a program that could control the movement of a steper motor from a website. Unfortunately, I quickly ran into problems with my metro board and huzzah. Although I successfully created a code to run the stepper motor in the past, I spent a lot of time trying to trouble shoot my problems.</p>

                <h1 class="page-header">Issues With the Stepper Motor</h1>
                <p>Ultimately, after hours of trial and error, I beleive I only just discovered the problem with my stepper motor control while writing up this website. When I tried to upload code to my metro, or other boards with the stepper motor connected, the USB port would connect and disconnect in quick succession, not allowing the code to actually be downloaded. If I disconnected the stepper, I could upload code, but after rewiring the stepper, no battery source could seem to consistantly support its power output. If the USB was plugged into the computer, it would begin to connect and disconnect rapidly, and if connected to a battery or an outlet, it would not run smoothly, seemingly running out of power after a few seconds and trying to reset.</p>
                <p>I have yet to have time to check if this is the solution, but I suspect I have found my mistake. In the past when I tested my stepper, I wired it to the VIN pin and also had the extra VIN port plugged into power. I noticed this when checking back in my website for the stepper. This time Iwired it directly to the 5V output. I suspect this must be the problem. Thefore, while I did not make much progress on the IoT control portion of this project, I will need to do something similar for my final project and this device will be coming. Unfortunatley, I just ran out of time trying to fix a silly mistake that seems to have a very simple solution. I will be testing this tonight after class and will post my results then.</p>

                <h1 class="page-header">ESP32-CAM</h1>
                <p>Becasue I had problems, with remote stepper motor control, I decide to try to work a little more with the ESP32-CAM which I will also need for my project. I was able to program the ESP32-CAM following the instruction on the website using the FTDI programmer. When uploading code, it was important to remember that the GPIO 0 pin must be connected to ground. Then, hitting a hard reset on the board and opening the 115200 baud serial monitor, we can get access to the ESP32-CAM's web address. I had already completed this part, so now I wanted to try and test it with the telescope. (Here I also played around with many of the features available on the ESP32-CAM website interface. The camera was actually quite simple to control from the website.)</p>
                <p>Therefore, instead of having the camera directly connected to the computer, I tried to have it compatible with the metro with wired serial communication. In this way, I could feed it power from whereever the telescope is without having it attached to my comuputer. This solution was actually fairly simple. </p>
                <p>I connected the power and ground pins from the metro to equivalent points on the ESP32-CAM. Then I wired the U0T pin of the ESP32-CAM to the RX pin 0 of the metro and the U0R pin from the ESP32-CAM to the TX pin 1 of the metro. Just by powering the metro with a battery, this produced a wireless signal that would produce a wireless image on my computer</p>

                <p>Finally, as a sort of proof of concept for my final project I attempted to take a picture through the lens of my telescope. Unfortunately, anywhere I could get a clear shot of the moon, I could not get a secure wifi connection, so instead, I just used my phone lens to try to take an image. The moon image actaully came out fairly well. However, my phone was trying to adjust for low light and took very long exposure pictures. As my hand moved slightly over the lens (and the moon quickly moved across the telescope's viewfinder, the moon went slightly out of focus. Therefore, I believe having the ESP32-CAM directly affixed to the telescope viewfinder will actually create a more stable, focused image than the camera test.</p>
