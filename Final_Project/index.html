                <h3>The Wirelessly Controlled Telescope Proposal:</h3>
                <p>I am still fairly uncertain about what I eventually want to do as my final project. However, my inital idea has to do with a telescope that I recently recieved. The telescope I have is already motorized and is remotely controlled by a wired attachment. Therefore, using the control panel, you can change where the telescope is pointed, adjusting both vertically and horizontally.</p> 
                <p>My project will hopefully solve a few problems. It will ideally allow for wireless control of the telescope's position, along with wireless focusing. I hope to also be able to render the viewfinder image on a device like a computer or phone. Additionally, becasue of the optics of the telescope, the image seen in the viewfinder is actually flipped from reality, so within this interface, I hope to convert the image to its true form.</p>
                <p>My idea is to add a removable camera to the end of the eyepiece (so it can be set up and used with a variety of different sized eyepieces). With this camera, I hope to be able to wirelessly attach it to my phone or computer so I can see the image on my device without having to look through the eyepiece. I think it would also be beneficial to motorize the focusing knobs to be wirelessly controlled from the same device interface. Hopefully, the positioning motors could also be controlled from here.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, the perfect viersion of my project would be an app on my phone that could be used to see through the telescope, control its position, and focus it to find and track things in the night sky. This could also be used to take high quality photos of the night sky. Maybe, someone else with the same app could even see through the telescope in real time, just without direct control of it.</p>

                <p>The basic, updated concept for my telescope design will be a wirelessly controlled focusing device for the telescope that allows you to actively see through the telescope lens as it is focused. To achieve this final product, I will need a stationary mount that attaches directly to the telescope. This will hold the necessary circuitry components and supply the support for the motors required to turn the focusing knobs. To actually attach the motors to the focusing knobs, I will likely have to 3D print a clamp-like, or tight fitting piece. Becasue there are knobs on each side of the lens, an extra motor could also be wired and attached to provide additional power and torque.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I will mount a detachable camera to the viewfinder at the end of the lens. The ESP32-CAM should work well for this function, and can be accessed over wifi. This would not only allow for complete remote control of the focusing mechanism, but it would also achieve my goal of allowing multiple people at different locations to be able to see exactly what I am through the telescope in real time.</p>

                <h3>Motor Control</h3>
                <p>For optimal control of the motor's rotation, the stepper motor will be used to turn the focusing knob. However, the motor didn't appear to have the necessary torque to actually turn the knobs. If affixed on the same axis as the focusing knob, the motor could just barely turn the knob, and only very inefficiently. To overcome this problem, I experimented with a few different concepts. Becasue the focusing knob is grooved, it is almost like a gear. Therefore, using a small grooved lego piece, I was able to make a gear ratio that was able to easily turn the focusing knob (although extremely slowly). For the true design, I can create ideally linking gears, designing one to fit perfectly aound the focusing knob and the other to slot onto the stepper motor.</p>

                <h4>The Gears:</h4>
                <p>As described above, gears will be the ideal way to adjust the focusing knob using the stepper motor. Therefore, in Fusion 360, I used the spurgear addon to easily create a few generic gears. For the ideal gear ratio, the stepper motor gears are much smaller than the focusing knob counterparts. I also added the D-shaped axle holes for the stepper motor and added thin planes across the face of the focusing knob gears (so they have a large surface area to be glued onto the knobs) which were measured to fit perfectly around the knobs.</p>

                <h4>The Clamp:</h4>
                <p>To create the clamp I decided to design two half cylinders that could be tightened with bolts to fit tightly around the telescope body. To do so I measured the diameter of the telescope and created a sketch with a circle just barely larger (in order to accont for slight error in the size of the telescope tube). To ensure it was guarunteed to fit tightly and securly, I removed a small portion of at the top and bottom where the bolts would attach. With slight give in the plastic material, this would surely pull the thin cylinder to fit nicely. Now, I just need to add a flat face to secure the stepper motor. I will drill holes on this flat area after it is printed to ensure the stepper motor is placed in the ideal place to allign the gears. Here I also added a flat "roof-like" feature for the metro board to have a place to easily attach to.</p>

                <h4>The ESP32-CAM Holder:</h4>
                <p>Finally, I needed to create the device that would hold the ESP32-CAM in place over the viewfinder lens. This had to be some sort of detachable feature that would hold the camera lens directly over the viewfinder lens. This design has a slot shaped perfectly for the ESP32-CAM to fit in back with just the camera lens able to fit through. This is centered within a circular piece that will fit over the viewfinder lens. It has notches to fit around the geometry already present on the telescope lens. To attach, bolts can be threaded through the holes in the side of the circular piece and tightened onto the viewfinder lens. These should also allow for microadjustments to ideally position the ESP32-CAM over the viewfinder. This part also had to be measured with very low tolerance. Some of the viewfinder lenses have only an extremely small area in which the bolts can possibly be fixed. This means that the bolt holes had to be placed in the perfect position to be able to grab onto the lens without slipping off.</p>

                <p>In order to 3D print my parts, I saved the fusion files as .stl mesh files and uploaded them to Prusa. From here I was able to slice each part individually using 0.2mm quality generic PLA filament. The individual .stl and .gcode files can be downloaded above. The gears and the ESP32-CAM Holder each had reasonable print times, however the telescope clamp was a very large print. It would take nearly 11.5 hours to print the telescope clamp. Therefore, to simplify the printed process, I combined all 3 parts into one print file. This was, the 3D printer could be run overnight once and produce all 3 pieces. Thanks to Nathan, Victoria and the Harvard 3D printers for helping make my parts a reality.</p>

                <p>Now it was time to experiment with the ESP32-CAM to make sure it would work well with my telescope. I followed the steps to upload the correct code on the <a href=https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-video-streaming-face-recognition-arduino-ide/> AI Thinker ESP32-CAM</a>. I had to wire it to the USB attached FTDI programmer and when uploading code, I had to connect the GPIO 0 pin to the ground pin as well. Then, removing the GPIO-0 to ground connection and opening the 115200 baud serial monitor, hitting the reset button on the ESP32-CAM produced the website link where I could access the video stream. Testing the ESP-32 CAM with an unfocused telescope produced an image almost identical to what I would see looking through the eye piece with my own eye. With this promising result, I had to wait for the next clear night to test how well it would work when focused on the moon.</p>
