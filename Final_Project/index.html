                <h3>The Wirelessly Controlled Telescope Proposal:</h3>
                <p>I am still fairly uncertain about what I eventually want to do as my final project. However, my inital idea has to do with a telescope that I recently recieved. The telescope I have is already motorized and is remotely controlled by a wired attachment. Therefore, using the control panel, you can change where the telescope is pointed, adjusting both vertically and horizontally.</p> 
                <p>My project will hopefully solve a few problems. It will ideally allow for wireless control of the telescope's position, along with wireless focusing. I hope to also be able to render the viewfinder image on a device like a computer or phone. Additionally, becasue of the optics of the telescope, the image seen in the viewfinder is actually flipped from reality, so within this interface, I hope to convert the image to its true form.</p>
                <p>My idea is to add a removable camera to the end of the eyepiece (so it can be set up and used with a variety of different sized eyepieces). With this camera, I hope to be able to wirelessly attach it to my phone or computer so I can see the image on my device without having to look through the eyepiece. I think it would also be beneficial to motorize the focusing knobs to be wirelessly controlled from the same device interface. Hopefully, the positioning motors could also be controlled from here.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, the perfect viersion of my project would be an app on my phone that could be used to see through the telescope, control its position, and focus it to find and track things in the night sky. This could also be used to take high quality photos of the night sky. Maybe, someone else with the same app could even see through the telescope in real time, just without direct control of it.</p>

                <p>The basic, updated concept for my telescope design will be a wirelessly controlled focusing device for the telescope that allows you to actively see through the telescope lens as it is focused. To achieve this final product, I will need a stationary mount that attaches directly to the telescope. This will hold the necessary circuitry components and supply the support for the motors required to turn the focusing knobs. To actually attach the motors to the focusing knobs, I will likely have to 3D print a clamp-like, or tight fitting piece. Becasue there are knobs on each side of the lens, an extra motor could also be wired and attached to provide additional power and torque.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I will mount a detachable camera to the viewfinder at the end of the lens. The ESP32-CAM should work well for this function, and can be accessed over wifi. This would not only allow for complete remote control of the focusing mechanism, but it would also achieve my goal of allowing multiple people at different locations to be able to see exactly what I am through the telescope in real time.</p>

                <h3>Motor Control</h3>
                <p>For optimal control of the motor's rotation, the stepper motor will be used to turn the focusing knob. However, the motor didn't appear to have the necessary torque to actually turn the knobs. If affixed on the same axis as the focusing knob, the motor could just barely turn the knob, and only very inefficiently. To overcome this problem, I experimented with a few different concepts. Becasue the focusing knob is grooved, it is almost like a gear. Therefore, using a small grooved lego piece, I was able to make a gear ratio that was able to easily turn the focusing knob (although extremely slowly). For the true design, I can create ideally linking gears, designing one to fit perfectly aound the focusing knob and the other to slot onto the stepper motor.</p>
